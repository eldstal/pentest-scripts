## system_recon
Scripts to collect basic data from a system where shell and root access are already available.

The scripts run in three phases:

- 1: User-only
- 2: Clean root (i.e. root-privilege but no system side-effects)
- 3: Intrusive root (i.e. installs system packages as needed)

1. Comment out phases in `run.sh` as needed
2. Disable external tools in `_setup.env` as needed
3. Invoke `run.sh <target_dir>` to generate a large number of text files in `<target_dir>`

Supports the following external tools (put them in `utils/` or point to them in `_setup.env`):
- [checksec.sh](https://github.com/slimm609/checksec.sh)
- [Lynis](https://cisofy.com/lynis)
- [Linux Exploit Suggester](https://github.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester)
- [LinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng)
